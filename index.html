            <p> 
              <strong>1. Who can apply?</strong> <br />
              PhD candidates with a startup idea are encouraged to apply. We are a group of PhD candidates working on our startup ideas while pursuing a degree. We strongly believe the training we get during our PhD can have a large scale impact through commercialization of our technologies and ideas. 

              
              <br /><br />
              <strong>2. Do I need to have a company to apply? </strong><br />
              You don’t have to be incorporated yet. However, we would like to see proof of concept in some form, and a commitment to develop the venture. The goal of this program is to give you access and a community so you can get your startup off the ground and raise your first capital. 

              <br /> <br />
              <strong>3. What does the application process look like?</strong> <br />
              Applications are due by Monday, May 23rd, 2022 at 11:59pm PST (late applications will not be accepted). Selected applicants will be given an interview within the following few days. After the interview, decisions will be sent out by late-June.

              <br /><br />
              <strong>4. What is the time commitment?</strong><br />
              We know you are busy, tired and overworked - so are we. Thus, we are going to keep this a low time commitment, high engagement and small cohort size so we can truly get to know each other. With guest speakers every Monday evening and participant share-outs and workshops every Thursday evening, you will get to spend quality time with some of the brightest minds of our generation.

              <br /><br />
              <strong>5. Is this program an accelerator?
              </strong> <br />
              No. This program is designed to support the side hustlers through education and community, to explore if this venture is a viable post-grad opportunity. We don't require that students continue their venture after graduation. There is no guarantee of funding from Dorm Room Fund, First Round, or any speakers/mentors from the sessions. However, we aim to help you take a big leap in the direction of progress

              <br /><br />
              <strong>6. What is Dorm Room Fund?
              </strong><br />
              Built by students and powered by First Round Capital, Dorm Room Fund provides founders with a strong network of investors, world-class mentors, and a $40,000 check. We’re a venture fund that has backed over 380 startups, whose founders have gone on to raise from the top venture capital firms.

              <br /><br />
              <strong>7. Where are the sessions?
              </strong> <br />
              All the sessions will be held online through video conferences and calls with the possibility of an in-person networking session

              <br /> <br />

              <strong>8. When are the sessions?
              </strong><br />
              Sessions tentatively run from June 6th, 2022 to August 8th, 2022 and the meetings will be held on Mondays and Thursdays from 8:30-9:30 ET/5:30-6:30 p.m PST.

              <br /><br />
              <strong>9. How much does it cost to participate in this program?
              </strong><br />
              Nothing. At Dorm Room Fund, we’re looking to support PhD founders in their pursuit to build amazing companies.

              <br /><br />
